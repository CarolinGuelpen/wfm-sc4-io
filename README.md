==========

Interorganizational code for Sc4, e.g. data exchange classes
"ExchangeMessages" is an Eclipse project which you can simply import into Eclipse.
You then need to include it on the Build Path of your Infinity Project. This way, the Java classes are maintained in a separate project (which saves you from copy-pasting all the time...), but may still be referenced by your workflow models.
